"Mosaic is a visual and live coding environment, based on openFrameworks "
"0.10.0, is open-source and, although it is multiplatform (OSX, Linux and "
"Windows) it is more logical that open source applications are used in "
"open source operating systems, so there are specific installation scripts"
" for different Linux distros."

"Most objects have connectors, on the left side are inlets and on the "
"right side are outlets. By dragging the mouse from the outlets we'll see "
"how a cable is stretched, and next to it we'll see the type of data it "
"transmits and the name of the outlet. When you bring the cable close to "
"the inlet of another object, that inlet increases in size if it is the "
"same type of data that the cable transmits, if it is another type of data"
" it cannot be connected."
